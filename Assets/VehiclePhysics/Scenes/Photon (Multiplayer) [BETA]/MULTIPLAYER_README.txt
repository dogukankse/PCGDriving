*** Multiplayer is still in state of development. This is just a preview. ***
Effects still do not work.

For multiplayer to start working:
1) Add "PHOTON_MULTIPLAYER" to File > Build Settings > Player Settings > Script Define Symbols
2) Download "Photon Unity Networking Classic - FREE" from Asset Store
3) Follow Photon's setup guide. Most important part is setting up PhotonServerSettings with AppId.
4) Load "PUN Scene"
5) Build it so you have two clients to test with. You can open multiple instances of your build to test with more players.
